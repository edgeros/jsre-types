edgeros/jsre types
---

This is the type declaration file provided for the erp project. Edgeros has its own javascript runtime. Because there is no running environment locally, we need to integrate the types file into the erp development environment through the cli tool.

### About version
The types major version will keep in sync with the EdgerOS JSRE. So when EdgerOS JSRE version is 1.14.x, types version is locked at 1.14, but the revision number is not necessarily the same.
