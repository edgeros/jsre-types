Unlike Node.js, EdgerOS JSRE is built on top of SylixOSÂ® kernel and light weight
JavaScript engine that is more memory efficient. Thanks to the self-owned OS
kernel, EdgerOS JSRE support both synchronous and asynchrous programming
mode and many other powerful utilities that may ease your development.
